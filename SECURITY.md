## Security Best Practices for Users

### ‚úÖ **Safe Usage**

- **Download only from official sources** (VS Code Marketplace)
- **Keep the extension updated** to the latest version
- **Review permissions** requested by the extension
- **Report suspicious behavior** immediately

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What to Avoid**

- Installing from unofficial sources
- Sharing learned pattern data that might contain sensitive code
