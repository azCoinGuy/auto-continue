# Security Checklist for Public GitHub Repository

## üîí Pre-Push Security Checklist

Before pushing to the public GitHub repository, ensure:

### ‚úÖ **Critical Security Items**

- [ ] No API keys, tokens, or credentials in any files
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords or secrets
- [ ] No personal information or email addresses (except in package.json if intended)
- [ ] No internal URLs, IP addresses, or server names
- [ ] No database connection strings
- [ ] No AWS/Azure/GCP credentials
- [ ] No SSH private keys or certificates
- [ ] No `.env` files or environment variables

### ‚úÖ **Extension-Specific Security**

- [ ] No extension marketplace tokens
- [ ] No publisher private keys
- [ ] No real user data or learned patterns from actual users
- [ ] No internal company code samples in tests
- [ ] No proprietary algorithms or business logic
- [ ] No debug logs with sensitive information

### ‚úÖ **File Review**

Review these files before pushing:
- [ ] `package.json` - No internal URLs or secrets
- [ ] `README.md` - No sensitive information
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` - No internal references
- [ ] All `.ts` files - No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Test files - No real-world sensitive data
- [ ] Configuration files - No production secrets

### ‚úÖ **GitHub Repository Settings**

Once pushed, configure:
- [ ] Enable branch protection on main branch
- [ ] Require pull request reviews
- [ ] Enable secret scanning
- [ ] Enable dependency vulnerability alerts
- [ ] Set up security policy (SECURITY.md)
- [ ] Configure issue templates

## üõ°Ô∏è **Additional Security Measures**

### **1. Secret Scanning Prevention**

Add these patterns to your git hooks or CI/CD:

```bash
# Common secret patterns to scan for
(?i)(password|passwd|pwd)\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"]+['"]
(?i)(api[_-]?key|apikey)\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"]+['"]
(?i)(secret|token)\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"]+['"]
(?i)(access[_-]?token)\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"]+['"]
```

### **2. Pre-commit Hooks**

Install and configure:
```bash
npm install --save-dev pre-commit
npm install --save-dev git-secrets
```

### **3. GitHub Security Features**

Enable in repository settings:
- **Secret scanning** - Automatically detect secrets
- **Dependency graph** - Track dependencies
- **Dependabot alerts** - Security vulnerability notifications
- **Code scanning** - Static analysis security testing

### **4. Safe Development Practices**

- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Never log sensitive information
- Use secure random generators for any IDs
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal

## üö® **Red Flags to Watch For**

Files/patterns that attackers commonly search for:

- Any file containing "password", "secret", "key", "token"
- Configuration files with production settings
- Backup files (.bak, .backup, .old)
- Log files with sensitive data
- Database dumps or exports
- SSH keys or certificates
- Docker files with hardcoded credentials
- CI/CD configuration with secrets

## üìù **Security Documentation**

Create these files for your public repository:

1. **SECURITY.md** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Security guidelines for contributors
3. **COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES.md** - Community guidelines

## üîç **Regular Security Audits**

Schedule regular checks:
- [ ] Monthly dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Quarterly secret scanning review
- [ ] Review of all new commits for security issues
- [ ] Check for any exposed sensitive data in git history

## üìû **Emergency Response**

If secrets are accidentally committed:
1. **Immediately** revoke/rotate the exposed credentials
2. Remove the secrets from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG
3. Force push the cleaned history
4. Notify affected services
5. Monitor for unauthorized access

**Remember: Once something is on public GitHub, assume it has been crawled and cached by search engines and bad actors. Prevention is better than remediation!**
